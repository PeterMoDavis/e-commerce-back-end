# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to build the back end of a e-commerce database that used RESTful routing so that the user can Create, Read, Update and Destroy information. During this project i immersed myself in Express and Sequelize routing paths to and from the database.

## Usage

Once you have a database set up in MySQL Workbench and you seed the files using "npm run seed" all you have to do is type "npm start" and you're ready to start putting in urls! You can check out the video [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xwCsIel1wPynDtSFxBMMMk48XV7ARvZ/view?usp=sharing)
